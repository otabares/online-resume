    <p>Welcome to my website! I created this site to introduce myself. The site is laid out like a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and it includes the following sections:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><a href="experience.html">Experience</a>, where I tell you about my current and previous jobs.</li>
        <li><a href="education.html">Education</a>, because learning is one of my greatest passions.</li>
        <li><a href="skills.html">Skills</a>, for it wouldn't be a r&eacute;sum&eacute; without a little boasting.</li>
        <li><a href="passions.html">Passions</a>, since the other categories are not enough.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Before you start exploring, let me tell you why I started Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree.</p>
    <p>I took my first web design class in 2002 when I was in tenth grade. At that time, XHTML was still the new kid in town, and CSS was just starting to gain popularity. Shortly after, I took two programming classes: QBasic and AP Computer Programming (Java). I struggled with Java and ended up dropping it. This experience left a bitter taste and led me to avoid programming for several years.</p>
    <p>In 2008, I took another Java programming class and did well. It was fun, but nothing else. Four years later, in 2012, I took an edX course to dabble further into the world of computer science. This course was 6.00x, MIT's <i>Intro to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</i>. It was intense. It was fun. It was frustrating. I was not ready yet.</p>
    <p>It's now been 15 years since I started exploring the wonderful world of computer science, and I'm finally ready. I'm ready to commit: that is why I started this nanodegree.</p>
    <p>Why did I start with Intro to Programming? I started with IPND because I want to ensure I close any potential gaps. However, I do not plan to stop with IPND. I'm looking forward to Full <i>Stack Web Development</i>, <i>Become an iOS Developer</i>, and beyond. In fact, my plan is to use this nanodegrees as preparation for Georgia Tech's OMSCS.</p>
    <p>I'm ready, and I'm excited for what the future holds.</p>
